			<p>For as long as he can remember, Jon Berry has roamed the far corners of the earth, regailing those in his path with tales most humorous. His education at the Savannah College of Art and Design resulted in a degree in Film and Television and a skill set that would serve him in his next endeavor: international advertising. Jon's passion for screenwriting and visual storytelling ultimately lead him to San Francisco, where he would go on to write for several game projects and ongoing web content.</p>

			<p>These days, Jon can be found developing narratives for gaming and virtual reality experiences, studying the future of storytelling in emergant mediums, and enjoying a partly-sunny Bay Area day with his wife and cat.</p>
